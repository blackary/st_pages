Author: [@blackary](https://github.com/blackary)

Code: https://github.com/blackary/st_pages

## Installation

```sh
pip install st-pages
```

## See it in action

Basic example: https://st-pages.streamlit.app/

Example with sections: https://st-pages-sections.streamlit.app/

## Why st-pages?

> Summary: st-pages allows you to set the page names, order, and icons (and optionally
> group the pages into sections) in a multipage Streamlit app from your code without
> having to rename the files.

Streamlit has native support for [multi-page apps](https://blog.streamlit.io/introducing-multipage-apps/)
where page filenames are the source of truth for page settings. But, it's a bit annoying
to have to change the filename to change the names in the sidebar or reorder the pages
in your app. Even more, I really dislike having to put emojis in filenames.

This is an experimental package to try out how page-management might work if
you could name the pages whatever you wanted, and could manage which pages are visible,
and how they appear in the sidebar, via a setup function.

This enables you to set page _name_, _icon_ and _order_ independently of file name/path,
while still retaining the same sidebar & url behavior of current streamlit multi-page
apps.

## How to use

### Method one: declare pages inside your streamlit code

```python
from st_pages import Page, show_pages, add_page_title

# Optional -- adds the title and icon to the current page
add_page_title()

# Specify what pages should be shown in the sidebar, and what their titles and icons
# should be
show_pages(
    [
        Page("streamlit_app.py", "Home", "🏠"),
        Page("other_pages/page2.py", "Page 2", ":books:"),
    ]
)
```

If you want to organize your pages into sections with indention showing which pages
belong to which section, you can do the following:

```python
from st_pages import Page, Section, show_pages, add_page_title

add_page_title() # By default this also adds indentation

# Specify what pages should be shown in the sidebar, and what their titles and icons
# should be
show_pages(
    [
        Page("streamlit_app.py", "Home", "🏠"),
        Page("other_pages/page2.py", "Page 2", ":books:"),
        Section("My section", icon="🎈️"),
        # Pages after a section will be indented
        Page("Another page", icon="💪"),
        # Unless you explicitly say in_section=False
        Page("Not in a section", in_section=False)
    ]
)
```

You can also create the list of pages dynamically and add an index to it:

```python
import os
from st_pages import Page, show_pages

# Specify folder containing pages
pages_folder = "pages"

# Get the alphabetically sorted filenames of the pages
pages_filenames = sorted(os.listdir(pages_folder))

# Create the page index dynamically
show_pages(
    [Page("app.py", "Home", "1")] + [Page(f"{pages_folder}/{page}", page[:-3], str(i+2)) for i, page in enumerate(pages_filenames)]
)
```

### Method two: declare pages inside of a config file

Contents of `.streamlit/pages.toml`

```toml
[[pages]]
path = "streamlit_app.py"
name = "Home"
icon = "🏠"

[[pages]]
path = "other_pages/page2.py"
name = "Page 2"
icon = ":books:"
```

Example with sections:

```toml
[[pages]]
path = "streamlit_app.py"
name = "Home"
icon = "🏠"

[[pages]]
path = "other_pages/page2.py"
name = "Page 2"
icon = ":books:"

[[pages]]
name = "My second"
icon = "🎈️"
is_section = true

# Pages after an `is_section = true` will be indented
[[pages]]
name = "Another page"
icon = "💪"

# Unless you explicitly say in_section = false`
[[pages]]
name = "Not in a section"
in_section = false
```

Streamlit code:

```python
from st_pages import show_pages_from_config, add_page_title

# Either this or add_indentation() MUST be called on each page in your
# app to add indendation in the sidebar
add_page_title()

show_pages_from_config()
```

# Hiding pages

You can now pass a list of page names to `hide_pages` to hide pages dynamically for each
user. Note that these pages are only hidden via CSS, and can still be visited by the URL.
However, this could be a good option if you simply want a way to visually direct your
user where they should be able to go next.
